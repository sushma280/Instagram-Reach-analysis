📊 **Instagram Reach Analysis**

This project explores the factors influencing Instagram post reach, providing data-driven insights to optimize content visibility and engagement. Using real-world data, it applies descriptive and inferential statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and regression modeling to identify key variables affecting post performance.

<br>

🧠 **Objective**

To analyze how different post features (like hashtags, content type, posting time, etc.) impact Instagram reach, and provide actionable recommendations for improving social media strategy.

<br>

🔍 **Key Features**

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Data cleaning, outlier detection, and feature engineering.

**Statistical Analysis:** Correlation, ANOVA, and regression analysis.

**Visualization:** Bar plots, heatmaps, boxplots to illustrate relationships and distributions.

**Modeling:** Linear regression model to identify the most influential factors on post reach.

<br>

🛠️ **Tools & Technologies**

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels)

Jupyter Notebook

MS Excel (initial data wrangling)

Word (for documentation and report creation)

<br>

📈 **Insights & Recommendations**

**Hashtag Use**: An optimal range of hashtags (not too many, not too few) increases reach.

**Post Timing**: Specific hours of the day/week yield better visibility.

**Content Type**: Reels and videos generally outperform images.

**Caption Length**: Concise captions perform better in engagement.

🧩 **Future Improvements**

Incorporate engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares) for deeper analysis.

Apply machine learning models (e.g., random forest) for better prediction.

Analyze user demographics or industry verticals for segmentation.
